In OrangeHRM link (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) only one set of valid username and password exists (Username : Admin, Password : admin123). 
Since in the task, we are asked to use five set of user details, I have used one valid user details and remaining four user credentials that I have used are random.
Kindly advise.
